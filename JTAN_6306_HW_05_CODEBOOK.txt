Variables 

names, names1, names2, and further iterations 
- cycling through data formats until I found one that the seperate function would accept

sep, sep2, sep3, sep4, ect
- dataframes of separated data, trimmed

y2015, y2016

y2
- final final data frame(should be named final but I didn't want to go back
and change everything), sorted with total column for instances across
both years
- it is super weird how some names have identical instances across both years, 
a mistake on my part??
